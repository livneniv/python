Livne Niv:  hi Niels, no order Yet... just several questions..
Livne Niv:  we havent yet registered or validated any domains with you, in case all of the paperwork is in order, how long does it usually take to complete the validation process?
Niels S:  5 to 10 business days
Livne Niv:  do you also validate for companies registered in Israel?
Niels S:  yes
Livne Niv:  that's good, 
Livne Niv:  when i fill the order form, it asks me - how many servers do i have
Livne Niv:  in case i have several web servers hosting the same site using a load balancer,
Livne Niv:  do i still have to pay per server?
Niels S:  that is a question you should ask sales, but in general you buy server licenses, so I think so
Livne Niv:  ok, thank you very much for your help, can you transfer me back to the sales?
